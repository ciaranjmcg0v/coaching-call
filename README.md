# UI/UX Presentation

This project is a React-based presentation that walks through a series of sections related to UI/UX best practices. Each section is loaded from markdown files and displayed dynamically in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Markdown-based content:** Sections are written in markdown and loaded dynamically.
- **Syntax highlighting:** Code blocks are highlighted with the Prism syntax highlighter.
- **Navigation:** Users can navigate between sections using "Previous" and "Next" buttons. The "Finish" button appears on the last section, leading to a final thank-you page.
- **Responsive design:** The presentation is optimized for all screen sizes with a clean, professional layout.

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `Presentation.tsx` – The main React component that controls the display and navigation of the presentation.
  - `content/` – The folder that contains the markdown files for each section of the presentation (e.g., `Section1.md`, `Section2.md`).

## How to Add More Sections

To add more sections to the presentation:

1. Add a new markdown file in the `content/` directory with the following format:

   ```markdown
   # Section Title

   Your section content goes here.
   ```

2. Update the `sectionFiles` array in `Presentation.tsx` to include the new section:

   ```ts
   {
     title: "New Section Title",
     path: "/content/NewSection.md",
   }
   ```

3. The new section will automatically be available in the navigation of the presentation.

## Features to Add
